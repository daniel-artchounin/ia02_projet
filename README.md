# Implementation of the board game **Mana**

In the context of the course Problem solving and logic programming (IA02) 
taught at Université de Technologie de Compiègne (UTC), we have implemented 
the board game [**Mana**](http://regle.jeuxsoc.fr/mana__rg.pdf) in Prolog. The 
project gives the opportunity to play various games: 
* Human versus Human 
* Human versus Artificial Intelligence 
* Artificial Intelligence versus Artificial Intelligence
